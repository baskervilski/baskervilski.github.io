BEWARE OF THIS OBSCURE pandas "FEATURE"


Maybe you have heard that you should encode the categorical features in your pandas.DataFrame using .astype('category'), 
which has multiple performance advantages: (usually) faster grouping & aggregation, (usually) much faster value counting, etc.


Usually.

Problem 1: You want group and aggregate your DataFrame using 2+ columns.

Suddenly, you notice your aggregation running for ages. You compare it to aggregation 

.groupby(['cat_col1', 'cat_col2', observed=True)


d = pd.DataFrame({
    'c1': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4],
    'c2': ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd']
})

d['c2'] = d['c2'].astype('category')

d.head(6).groupby('c2')['c1'].mean()
